\mysection{Projects}{

{\bf Dental Care: Orthodontic Predictor} \hfill December 2012--February 2013\\
Developed an algorithm in C/C++ for suggesting a dental patient whether
the patient needs orthodontic treatment using a naive Bayes classifier.\\
    
{\bf System for Predicting and Preventing Work-Related Musculoskeletal
Disorders among Dentists} \hfill May 2011--August 2011\\
Developed algorithms in C/C++ for predicting and preventing work-related
musculoskeletal disorders among dentist using hidden Markov models and
Bayesian networks. The work has been published in Computer Methods in
Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering. (Available at
\url{http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10255842.2012.672565})\\
