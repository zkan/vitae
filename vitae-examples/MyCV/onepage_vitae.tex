\begin{cvlist}{Technical Experience}
\item
\begin{itemize}\itemsep=0.25em
	\item Graduate research focus was wireless networking, specifically

	\item Graduate work included extensive network simulation
	(\emph{ns-2}, which uses C++ and OTcl), 
	a sensor hardware implementation (TinyOS/NesC),
	a user-level ad hoc routing implementation, Perl scripts for
	data parsing and graphing as well as simple simulators, and LaTeX
	for reports and documentation.
	\item Several semester group projects for graduate coursework,
	including a Java-based tool for younger students to create graphical
	life stories and a custom built Bluetooth simulator written in C.
	\item Graduate coursework included assignments in
	other domains, such as Unix sockets, ML, Prolog, Lisp.
	\item Undergraduate research included developing a Java-based
	visualization tool for a scientific computing problem solving
	environment to control message passing between modules and array
	partitioning.
	\item Nine-month electrical engineering co-op at Michelin in 1998.
